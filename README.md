This template should help get you started developing with Vue 3 in Vite. The template uses Vue 3 `<script setup>` SFCs, check out the [script setup docs](https://v3.vuejs.org/api/sfc-script-setup.html#sfc-script-setup) to learn more.

# Design

I used the design from this [figma](<https://www.figma.com/design/bwpwnEW0MiYLqO141teykS/OnTrip-Travel-Website-(Community)?node-id=1-2&p=f&t=TSS6GScma3kVqNz9-0>)
as a reference for studying and practicing web development by recreating the design. This is purely for educational purposes, and I do not intend to use it for commercial purposes or generate any revenue from it.
